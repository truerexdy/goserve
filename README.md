# goserve
A simple and basic http server written in Go-Lang using the net/http package of the Go-Lang standard library.

Intention behind creating this repo is to write a robust basic go http server which can then be used as base in my future projects.

Why Go? Here's my reasons,
- Compiled
- Concurrency
- Simple
- Robust
- Pretty good standard library
- net/http package
